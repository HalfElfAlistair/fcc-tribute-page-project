## Introduction

Made as part of the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Meet the 16 user stories in [the brief](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

- User Story 1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

- User Story 2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

- User Story 3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

- User Story 4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

- User Story 5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

- User Story 6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

- User Story 7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

- User Story 8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

- User Story 9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.


### Personal Aims

Get a better grip of mobile-first responsive design and writing better organised and concise code.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- codepen.io/FCC: Test Suite Template

I used VSC and Chrome Devtools to compile my code. Then copied the <body> and CSS into the codepen test suite.

### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
The educational and practical opportunity to develop my coding skills.

### [WebAIM.org](https://webaim.org/)
Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.

### [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)
I use their 'create a palette' tool to help me select a colour scheme.

### [sumit chauhan on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sumitchauhandev/)
I'd read a forum post suggesting Flickr as a possible place to acquire images for projects. Searching for Tommy Wiseau yielded some suitable options and I chose this one from them.

### Charles Bramesco at Vulture
They wrote [an article about Tommy Wiseau](https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/everything-we-definitely-know-about-the-rooms-tommy-wiseau.html) that I used to check over rumours I'd heard before applying them as content. It was really helpful and turned out to cover the things I was planning to use.

### Ali Golub at NYULocal
This article was also handy when I wanted to remind myself of the [link between Wiseau and DB Cooper](https://nyulocal.com/new-world-university-tommy-wiseau-is-d-b-cooper-e2239d054320).


## Author Notes

Getting the page to pass the project tests wasn't so easy with more than one image so I removed some others I had in there. It's a shame as it would be a lot better with a few more but it is still functional which is the priority.

I'm a huge fan of The Room and fascinated by Tommy Wiseau so this was the easiest and most fun project for content drafting. On the other hand it didn't feel overly exciting to code, it was more like an article which is the format I followed.

To be honest, my first couple of projects were designed for desktop initially. I've since done more research on mobile first design as I was aware this was best practice. This project and the technical documentation page were my first attempts at mobile-first and have helped me get the hang of it a lot better. I'm a lot more comfortable with responsive design in general from doing these projects, which is the aim of the game!
