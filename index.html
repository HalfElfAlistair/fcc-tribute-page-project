                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Little is truly known about Tommy Wiseau, despite a lot of research from fans and even a book partly detailing his life.<br><br>A clear picture of his origin is yet to emerge, with various suggestions offered by inquisitive fans.<br><br>The main thing we do know is that he is responsible for <a href="http://theroommovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" id="tribute-link">"The Room"</a>; a film many claim to be the worst of all time. Released in 2003 Wiseau's masterpiece has gained a cult following and even a film partly about it's making.</p>

                <h2>Where is Tommy from?</h2>
                <p>Although Wiseau considers himself an American these days, he was not born there.<br><br>His country of origin has long been a subject of speculation for The Rooms cult following.</p>
                <h3>Europe</h3>
                <p>The Disaster Artist, written by co-star Greg Sestero, seems to shed light on Tommy's past.<br><br>The author describes an upbringing in Eastern Europe before a move to France. From there it is claimed Wiseau found his way over to Louisiana in the USA.<br><br>Due to how close Sestero is to Wiseau, this account is the most plausible. Greg does acknowledge how difficult it is to obtain information on his friend's past though.<br><br>Additionally, pinpointing an exact city or even country for TW's beginnings has proven difficult.<br><br>This leaves room for debate with some rather wild rumours...</p>
                <h3>The Past</h3>
                <p>Let's be honest, it's the wild theories that are the most interesting. Wiseau certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to those.<br><br>His somewhat peculiar accent, coupled with his vampiric looks, could lead people to believe he's actually from hundreds of years ago.<br><br>Adding to his 'European' origins, we could even vouch for him as a Transylvanian native like Dracula. Plus he has claimed to have grown up in New Orleans, a place also considered a hotspot by vampire theorists.<br><br>Wiseau has supposedly written a film about vampires and is even known to have joked about being one.<br><br>There are scenes in The Room where he sets foot outside during daylight hours, so this rumour may be easily debunked.</p>
                <h3>Space</h3>
                <p>Some fans have perhaps over analysed the script in The Room but it has lead to an amusing theory about Tommy<br><br>During a fight at the party near the films end, Mark (played by Greg) exclaims "what planet are you on?". Could it be that Wiseau inserted this line as a subtle hint towards an extra terrestrial origin?<br><br>Of course this is a fantastical idea to be taken with a pinch of salt. It did gain some ground with Marvel though, they made reference to Wiseau being a alien crime lord in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/fhdf0m/til_that_tommy_wiseau_is_an_alien_in_earth616_oh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Captain Marvel comic</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Bottomless Bank Account</h2>
                <p>Even before the Disaster Artist was published, a big question fans of The Room had was 'where did Wiseau find $6,000,000 for the movie?'<br><br>And the release of the book only fueled the fire in this regard.<br><br>On cashing a cheque, a bank employee describes Wiseaus account as 'a bottomless pit'.<br><br>Let's take a look at some of the likely and unlikely possibilities.</p>
                <h3>An Entrepeneur</h3>
                <p>Sestero does provide a story of how Tommy Wiseau acquired his wealth, from conversations with the man himself.<br><br>As usual it lacks a lot of detail that would help paint a clear picture.<br><br>Taken at face value Wiseau took various jobs and developed a knack for sales before moving into retail business and then property.<br><br>This is backed up to a decent extent as footage of his 'Steet Fashions USA' commercial is widely available.<br><br>Additionally the coffee shop scene in The Room was filmed on one of his retail properties.<br><br>Why Wiseau used a parking lot and greenscreen to film rooftop scenes, when he had a perfectly good rooftop available at these properties, is a source of debate in The Disaster Artist.</p>
                <h3>Money Laundering</h3>
                <p>There are claims that The Room is actually a big, huge money laundering scheme and Wiseau could be part of or even king of a criminal empire.<br><br>This coincidentally links to the alien theory mentioned earlier and it is likely Marvel took some inspiration from the theory when drafting their comic script.<br><br>The secrecy surrounding Wiseau does lend itself to someone with a nefarious background.<br><br>As of yet there haven't been any run-ins with law enforecemnt, other than a Canadian court dispute about a documentary on The Room. Thus it is likely his money and film are both legitimate.<br><br>Additionally, Sestero considers the ciminal theories to be dubious and he's the best source we have on Tommy's background.</p>
                <h3>DB Cooper</h3>
                <p>Like the vampire theory for Wiseau's origins, there is a wonderfully entertaining story that circulated about TW's wealth.<br><br>In 1971 DB Cooper (an alias) hijacked a plane, acquired $200,000 ransom and parachuted out, never to be seen again.<br><br>A 2014 <a href="https://xkcd.com/1400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xkcd web comic</a> propsed a comparison of Cooper and Wiseau, using a few vague points.<br><br>Of course this was almost certainly intended as a joke but people have run away with the idea.<br><br>It is fairly easily debunked. For example, even if we assume he's older than he claims, Wiseau would still have been fairly young back in 1971.<br><br>Tommy has also subsequently denied the link when asked about it.</p>
